Data: The snow falls soft, a silent grace,
Upon the world, a winter's embrace.
Christmas lights begin to gleam,
A festive, joyful, hopeful dream.

The scent of pine, a sweet perfume,
Fills every room, dispelling gloom.
Carols sung, a gentle sound,
As love and peace on Earth abound.

With hearts so warm, and spirits bright,
We gather close on Christmas night.
Sharing laughter, joy, and cheer,
A time of love, held ever dear.
